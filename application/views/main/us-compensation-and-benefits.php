                    If you're recruiting jobs in the U.S., you'll have to make sure you're up to date with both state
                    and federal compensation and benefit specifications. On the surface, the United States doesn't have
                    many regulations regulating employee salaries and benefits â€” so if you want to compete with other
                    companies, you'll need to provide certain benefits.</span>

                        the federal minimum wage is set, but some states have their own higher rates. The federal
                        minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.

                        sick leave, and other benefits. As a result, many people consider them while looking for their

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Health Insurance </span> - Medical care is regarded
                            as one of the most essential aspects of an employee compensation package by applicants, and
                            as a result, the majority of employers provide it. Bear in mind that if you have more than
                            49 full-time employees, the ACA's "affordability" clause restricts the maximum premium you
                            can charge an employee.

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Life Insurance </span> - Life insurance is commonly
                            provided, but not as commonly as health insurance. Many employers provide free life
                            insurance in the amount of the employee's annual salary. If the price is too high for you,
                            you can agree to pay for part of the policy and ask the employee to contribute the rest if
                            they wish to participate.
                          </li>

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Dental Insurance </span> - Another common employee
                            perk, though not as common as health insurance, is dental insurance. The good news is that
                            dental care is far less expensive than medical care for both you and your staff. An 80/20
                            split between employer and employee is a standard ratio, but you can certainly change it to
                            find a better match for your business.

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Retirement (mention 401K) </span> - 401(k)s and
                            403(b)s are the two most popular forms of employer-sponsored retirement plans. The plan
                            depends on whether you're a for-profit or non-profit company.
                            <p class="mb-0 mt-10">
                              <span class="us_paragraph"> Some employers opt to match their employees' contributions to their retirement plans, incentivizing reluctant savers. In a standard matching scenario, the employer matches 50% of employee contributions up to the first 6% of salary. In this situation, the company's match is limited to 3% of the employee's salary. Other businesses can guarantee a 100 percent match, up to a certain limit. Others simply contribute to a 401(k) directly.</span>

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Paid Vacation & Sick Leave </span> - Full-time workers are typically given two weeks (10 days), with some businesses allowing employees to accrue extra PTO if they remain with the company for a long period of time.

                            <span class="us_sub_heading_highlights">Paid Medical Leaves  </span> - The Family Medical Leave Act mandates that employers with 50 or more full-time employees have to provide medical leave. This includes maternity leave, time off for staff recovering from surgery, and time off for family members who are ill. The FMLA requires you to keep the person's job open for a duration of 12 weeks, but it does not require you to pay them for their time off.

                              <span class="us_paragraph"> Employers also provide six weeks of paid leave (often in full) and then encourage workers to take additional weeks using vacation or sick days. </span>
