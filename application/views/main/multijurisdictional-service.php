                                new subsidiary. They needed us to help with their oil rigs in the Indian Ocean. Our
                                client’s subsidiary was based in the UAE, our workers were sourced from India. The
                                clients needed payments to be in Euros. The hassle was enough for us to walk away from
                                the project, then we called Globalization Solutions. They sent us one simple monthly
                                invoice in US dollars and handled everything else.
